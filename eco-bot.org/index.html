    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>Eco-Bot started as a project to create an educational robotics kit that would encourage kids to reuse materials <a href="projects/project1.html">[link here]</a> as well as get excited about engineering.</p>

    <p>The educational kit didn't make it to fruition (or at least I am not ready for it to exist) I didn't feel it was right to champion an idea wthout feeling as if I had understood how to properly combine technology and sustainability, two forces completely at odds, but two things I feel thoroughly passionate about.</p>
        
    <p>This blog/website/thing (its the current year does it really need labels) seeks to document and explore how these two ideas can work hand-in-hand. As I explore how to get better at creating and explore how to make more ethical and conscious creations (not to sound too full of myself).</p>
        
    <p>There is chance that there will be lots of slow progress, times where terrible decisions are made, decisions that make no sense, obvious mistakes, you get the gist. But if this ... Eco-Bot ... encourages you to think about your decisions, or even inspires you to try to make something or make a change for the better then it has done it's job.</p>
        
    <p>The environment is great, robots are very cool. Surely we can figure out a way for chalk and cheese to be worthy of a Michelin star.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>Here shows a list of all the projects so far, they are not the most impressive projects, however the point is learning and exploring. I would like to apologise for how hard I bumble my way through as I learn, but it can't be helped, it's just much more fun that way.</p>
